# Facial-Expression-Recognition-Using-OpenCV
To build our facial expression recognition system. Weâ€™ll first perform face detection, extract face embeddings from each face using deep learning, train a facial expression recognition model on the embeddings, and then finally recognize expression in both images and video streams with OpenCV.
